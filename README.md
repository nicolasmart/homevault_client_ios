## HomeVault Client for iOS

This app is meant to be used as a client for the HomeVault Server project. You can find the server part [here](https://github.com/nicolasmart/homevault_server).

## Installation

You will need a machine running macOS with Xcode installed and an iOS device. Clone this repository, open the project in Xcode, connect your device via USB and build. If you don't have a developer account, you will have to resign the app every week.
